### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maya, a student and hobbyist DevOps engineer, based in the Netherlands.

She/it, takes [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) way too seriously for fun, does other fun stuff.

I have a homeserver on which I run Proxmox, on top of which I run a multitude of things such as:
- a pfSense custom router which has an IP-SEC Tunnel between my server and my partner's servers,
- a TrueNAS instance which is used by quite some other personal projects, but also things like photos that are important to me,
- a DNS server, which also syncs with afformentioned partner's server,
- a Navidrome music server,
- an Immich photo hosting server, including a very cool facial recognition.

There's still some things I wanna set up, such as monitoring tools such as Grafana with InfluxDB.

In terms of programming, I haven't done as much of that as infrastructure stuff, but trying to get into it again.
I like Go, I have a good amount of experience with C#, I want to learn either or both C and Rust.
