### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maya, a student and hobbyist DovOps engineer, based in the Netherlands.

She/her, takes [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) way too seriously for fun, does other fun stuff.
I'm currently studying for a HBO Bachelor degree.

I have a homeserver on which i run Proxmox, on top of which i run a multitude of things such as:
- a pfSense custom router which has an IP-SEC Tunnel between my partners' servers,
- a TrueNAS instance which is used by quite some other personal projects, but also things like photos that are important to me.
- a DNS server, which also syncs with afformentioned partners' server
- a Navidrome music server
- a Immich photo hosting server, including a very cool facial recognition

Still have some things i wanna setup, such as monitoring tools such as Grafana with InfluxDB
